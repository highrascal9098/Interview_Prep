    "question": "What is Playwright's main advantage over older tools like WebDriver?",
    "solution": "Playwright runs out-of-process, meaning it is not bound by the limitations of the browser's JavaScript environment. Its main advantages are native auto-waiting, context isolation, and simultaneous cross-browser testing."

    "solution": "By setting the environmental variable PLAYWRIGHT_DEBUG=1 before running tests, the Playwright Inspector will launch, allowing step-by-step execution, exploration of selectors, and viewing the action log."
